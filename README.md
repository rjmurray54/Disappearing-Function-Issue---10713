# Disappearing-Function-Issue---10713
Good Morning Kseniia,

Attached are two videos, the first one shows creating the Function, closing the Tab and closing DBeaver.  The second video show when I come back into DBeaver, the function is GONE!  The interesting thing was I was using CTRL-Enter to execute the function and then when I closed the Tab and refreshed the function list, the function would be gone.  So, I used the button you were using and the function is still there now.  But now when I close and re-open DBeaver, now the function is gone.  So, part of it has been corrected by using the button to execute it, instead of CTRL-ENTER.
